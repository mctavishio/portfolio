	Kathy McTavish's artwork is a vibrant and dynamic exploration of the intersection of art, science, and technology. Her work is characterized by its use of generative processes, which involve the creation of art through automated algorithms and computer programming. McTavish's use of generative processes allows for the creation of endlessly evolving and unpredictable artworks, which draw the viewer into a constantly changing visual and auditory experience.
	</p><p>
Like Lucy Lippard, McTavish's work challenges traditional notions of artistic expression, by emphasizing the importance of process and algorithmic systems. Her art is not simply a product of her own artistic vision, but rather a collaborative creation between the artist and the technology that she uses to create her installations.
	</p><p>
Through her work, McTavish also explores the idea of interactivity and audience participation. Her installations invite the viewer to engage with the artwork and become an active participant in the creation of the overall experience. This focus on interactivity creates a unique and engaging experience for the viewer, and challenges traditional ideas of the passive viewer in the gallery or museum setting.
	</p><p>
Overall, McTavish's artwork is a bold and innovative exploration of the potential of technology to create new forms of artistic expression, and her use of generative processes and interactive installations creates an immersive and thought-provoking experience for viewers.

Kathy McTavish's artwork is a wild and visionary exploration of the boundaries of art and technology. Her installations are like ecstatic visions, pulsing with energy and life, and drawing the viewer into a hypnotic trance of light and sound.
	</p><p>
Using algorithms and generative processes, McTavish creates artworks that are alive with movement and change, swirling and shifting in a constant state of flux. Her art is not simply an expression of her own individual vision, but rather a collaboration between her own creative impulse and the digital systems that she uses to generate the art.
	</p><p>
In McTavish's installations, the viewer becomes a participant, drawn into the artwork and invited to engage with the piece. The interactive nature of her work creates a sense of community and connection, as the audience becomes part of the artwork itself.
	</p><p>
McTavish's installations are like an explosion of color and sound, a cacophony of voices and images that challenge the viewer to expand their sense of what is possible. Her art is a celebration of the infinite potential of technology to create new forms of artistic expression, and a call to embrace the power of creativity to transform the world around us.

	</p><p>
	Like a spider weaving a web, McTavish creates intricate, multi-threaded systems in their art. They use chance-infused patterns to explore the boundaries between humans and machines, much like how spiders use their webs to capture prey and navigate their surroundings. McTavish's work, like a spider's web, can be both delicate and strong, with layers of sound, data, text, and abstract moving images. And just as spiders can adapt their webs to different environments, McTavish has created installations in a variety of spaces, from traditional galleries to abandoned buildings, using the resonance and ambient sounds of each space to enhance their work.

	<h1><a href="#top">^</a> what is generative art?</h1>
	</header>
	<p> 
Generative, algorithmic art refers to the use of algorithms or code to create art that is not predetermined or fixed, but rather evolves or unfolds over time. It involves setting up a system of rules or instructions that determine the behavior of the artwork, allowing for a degree of unpredictability and variation in its output. This can lead to the creation of complex and intricate patterns, shapes, and forms that would be difficult or impossible to produce through traditional artistic methods. The artist often plays the role of a designer or curator, creating the initial algorithm or ruleset, but relinquishing control over the final outcome. Generative, algorithmic art is often associated with new media and digital technologies, but can also be produced through more traditional mediums such as painting or sculpture.
